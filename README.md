# Zephyrus_CPU_Mode

Since most of us are limiting CPU to 3GHz, I have created simple powershell script to lay in the systray and allow easy switching from Agressive CPU to Efficent Agressive. Just in case You need additional 1.2GHz.

Instructions:

1.Unzip folder "Scripts" to C:\

2.Copy file CPU Mode.lnk

3. Open "Run" (Win + R) and Type: shell:startup

4. Paste the file into startup folder. From now, app will start with windows



You can also manualy run it from shortcut.

If Your systray icon is hiding, change it in taskbar settings.



UPDATE 1: Cleaned up unused functions. I will later add screen refresh options for 60/120Hz


If You have idea about additional options or functions I can add them.
